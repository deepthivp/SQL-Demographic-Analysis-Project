## SQL Demographic Analysis Project

This repository contains SQL scripts and queries used to perform a comprehensive analysis of Indian demographic data. The project involves extracting, analyzing, and deriving insights from datasets related to population, growth rates, literacy, and sex ratio across various states in India.

### Project Overview
This SQL project is focused on analyzing demographic data to uncover trends and insights. Key tasks include:
- Extracting data from two main datasets.
- Analyzing population distribution, growth rates, literacy rates, and sex ratios.
- Performing advanced SQL operations to calculate demographic metrics and trends.

Key SQL Techniques Used:
Joins: Combining data from multiple tables to generate comprehensive datasets.
-Unions: Merging results from different queries to create unified outputs.
- Subqueries: Nesting queries to perform complex data retrieval operations.
- Aggregate Functions: Calculating sums, averages, counts, and other aggregate metrics.
- Window Functions: Ranking and partitioning data to provide detailed analysis.

### Contents
- Scripts: SQL scripts used for data extraction and analysis.
-DataSets

### Findings
- Population Analysis: Detailed breakdown of the population across states.
- Growth Trends: Insights into the average growth rates at national and state levels.
- Literacy Rates: Identification of states with the highest and lowest literacy rates.
- Sex Ratio Disparities: Examination of the average sex ratio across states.

### Conclusion
This project showcases the power of SQL in analyzing and deriving meaningful insights from large demographic datasets. The findings can assist in policy formulation, resource allocation, and understanding regional development dynamics.
